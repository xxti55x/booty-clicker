# DECISIONS.md

Log of non-obvious engineering decisions, newest first. Each milestone appends
here (spec §7).

## M1 — Persistenz

- **2026-07-16 — `suppressSave` guard on reset.** `reset()` wipes the save and
  reloads the page; without a guard, the 10 s autosave interval or a
  `visibilitychange`/`beforeunload` firing between the wipe and the reload
  could resurrect the just-deleted save. `suppressSave` is flipped before
  `resetSave()` runs so `persist()` becomes a no-op for the remainder of that
  page's lifetime.

- **2026-07-16 — Armed-button double-confirm instead of `window.confirm`.**
  The reset button arms on first click (visual state + 4 s auto-revert) and
  only fires on a second click while armed. Keeps the destructive action
  in-page and stylable, matching the game's UI language, rather than a native
  browser dialog.

- **2026-07-16 — Settings folded into the shop as a 4th tab.** No new panel
  chrome, no extra toggle — reuses `Shop`'s existing tab/tabbody plumbing
  (generalized from a hard-coded 3-way switch to a `data-t` → element map) so
  Export/Import/Reset live where players already look for game controls.

- **2026-07-16 — UTF-8-safe base64 via `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`.** Plain
  `btoa(JSON.stringify(...))` breaks on multi-byte characters (skin/BG names
  contain emoji). Encoding routes bytes through `TextEncoder` before `btoa`
  and reverses via `atob` + `TextDecoder`, so export/import codes survive
  round-tripping any save content.

- **2026-07-16 — `SaveStorage` injected behind a 3-method interface.** Vitest
  runs in the `node` environment (no jsdom, per project convention) with no
  `localStorage`. Every persistence function takes an optional `SaveStorage`
  (defaulting to `globalThis.localStorage` wrapped in a try/catch) so tests
  inject an in-memory `Map`-backed fake and the whole save layer is
  unit-testable without a DOM.

- **2026-07-16 — Derived stats (`perClick`/`perSec`/`mult`) are never
  persisted or trusted from disk.** The save stores only `bp` and upgrade
  _levels_ keyed by id; on load, levels are applied to a fresh
  `createUpgrades()` and stats are rebuilt via the existing pure
  `deriveStats`. A tampered or stale stored multiplier can never leak into a
  loaded game — it's simply never read.

- **2026-07-16 — v1 schema defined retroactively.** M0 never shipped a save
  format, so `SaveDataV1` (positional upgrade array, derived stats stored
  directly, no `lastSeen`) is a reconstruction of "what the naive M0
  serialization would have looked like," giving the migration registry
  (`MIGRATIONS[1] = migrateV1toV2`) a real predecessor to prove the upgrade
  path against instead of starting the chain at v2 only.

## M0 — Scaffold & Port

- **2026-07-16 — Spec kept as `booty-clicker-spec.md`, `AGENTS.md` is a pointer.**
  Spec §3 lists `AGENTS.md` as "dieses Dokument". Rather than rename the file the
  task explicitly references, we keep the full spec under its original name and add
  a short `AGENTS.md` operating guide that links to it. Both requirements satisfied,
  nothing the user pointed at disappears.

- **2026-07-16 — npm workspaces monorepo (`apps/game`, `apps/api`).**
  Matches spec §3 layout. Shared dev tooling (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript) is
  hoisted to the root; runtime deps (Three.js, Vite) live in `apps/game`.

- **2026-07-16 — Three.js via npm, `OrbitControls` from `three/examples`.**
  The prototype loaded Three r128 from cdnjs and hand-rolled an orbit camera. Per
  spec §5 M0 we depend on the `three` npm package (`^0.180`) and replace the custom
  camera with `OrbitControls` (zoom limits 5–24). No CDN dependency remains.

- **2026-07-16 — Vite `base: './'` (relative paths).**
  Required so the production build runs from a file path / itch.io ZIP (spec §5 M6),
  set up early to avoid a late-stage path rewrite.

- **2026-07-16 — `economy.ts` extracted as pure, data-driven module first.**
  The cost formula `floor(base·gr^lv)`, combo bonus (+5%/stack) and multiplicative
  mult-stacking are ported verbatim from the prototype into pure functions with a
  typed `UPGRADES` config array, covered by 3+ Vitest unit tests. `deriveStats`
  folds upgrade levels so stats can be reconstructed from a save (needed for M1).

- **2026-07-16 — M0 delivered in two commits:** (1) scaffold + toolchain + economy
  tests, (2) full behavioural port of the prototype into modules.
  Keeps each commit independently green and reviewable.

- **2026-07-16 — `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` disabled.** It is not part of `strict`
  and added heavy friction across the ported Three.js code (palette lookups, pose
  channels, geometry attributes). `strict` plus `noUnusedLocals/Parameters`,
  `noImplicitReturns` and `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` stay on.

- **2026-07-16 — Port structure.** The 646-line prototype was split by spec §3
  directory: `engine/` (scene, renderer, lights, env, OrbitControls camera,
  material helpers), `character/` (rig, physics, skins), `choreo/` (moves +
  `Choreographer`), `world/` (backgrounds + `World`), `game/` (economy, state),
  `ui/` (hud, shop, format), wired in `main.ts`. Transient runtime signals
  (combo, drive) live outside the serializable `GameState`. Three r128 deprecations
  updated: `outputEncoding`→`outputColorSpace`, texture `.encoding`→`.colorSpace`,
  `physicallyCorrectLights` dropped (physical lighting is the r0.180 default).

- **2026-07-16 — M0 verified.** Headless Chromium smoke test: no page/console
  errors, WebGL context created, HUD/shop render (7 upgrades), clicking increments
  BP with the combo bonus. `npm run build` → dist 552 KB (< 5 MB budget); `npm test`
  9 green; lint + format clean.
